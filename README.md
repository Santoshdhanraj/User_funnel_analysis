# User Engagement Funnel Analysis â€“ SaaS Product

This portfolio project analyzes user behavior across a SaaS onboarding funnel and identifies key drop-off stages to optimize user conversion from sign-up to subscription.

---

# Objective

Simulate a real-world onboarding funnel for a SaaS product and analyze conversion at each step. The goal is to uncover significant drop-offs and generate actionable insights using SQL, Python, and dashboarding tools.

---

# Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQL
- Google BigQuery (cloud-based analysis)
- Looker Studio (dashboard visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

# Funnel Stages Simulated

1. **Sign-Up**  
2. **Email Verification**  
3. **Onboarding Tutorial**  
4. **Feature Use**  
5. **Subscription**

Using a dataset of 50,000 simulated users, the project measures conversion at each stage and segments trends by acquisition channel and region.

---

# Key Insights

- A **~40% drop-off** was observed between Onboarding and Feature Use â€” the most critical point in the funnel.
- Proposed targeted in-app nudges to improve engagement.
- Simulated A/B testing showed a **10% improvement** in conversion.
